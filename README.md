# WeatherBot
The project involved the development of a serverless chatbot for weather information, which leveraged cloud technologies to support text-based and voice-based interactions.
The chatbot included an intuitive voice interface that ensured a seamless user experience, while an aesthetically pleasing interface was created using HTML and CSS. 
The project was built using a range of AWS services, including Lex, Lambda, Cloudfront, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB.
